//Q6. Explain the concept of prototypes in JS. How is it related to Classes in ES6


/* 

Prototype help JavaScript in achieving the concepts of Object Oriented Programming.
When a function is created in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine adds a prototype property 
to the function. This prototype property is an object (called as prototype object) which 
has a constructor property by default. The constructor property points back to the function 
on which prototype object is a property. We can access the functionâ€™s prototype property 
using functionName.prototype.
we can also attach methods and properties in a prototype object, which enables all 
the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.
